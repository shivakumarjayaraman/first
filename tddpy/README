The python modules needed by this project are all installed in a virtualenv. This was initially created using the command

virtualenv mytest

However, this is something that needs to be just done once. 

Later, just run 

source mytest/bin/activate 

The python env here has django, selenium etc .. 

To come out of the env, just type deactivate
